# Scholarship Smart Contract Platform

## Overview

This project implements a blockchain-based scholarship platform using Move on the Aptos blockchain. The platform allows donors to create scholarships with specific criteria, and eligible students can apply for these scholarships. Once the criteria are met, scholarships are automatically awarded and distributed through smart contracts.

## Features

- **Scholarship Creation**: Donors can create scholarships with specific criteria and amounts.
- **Application Process**: Students can apply for scholarships by submitting an application that meets the specified criteria.
- **Automatic Awarding**: Scholarships are automatically awarded to students who meet the criteria.
- **Fund Withdrawal**: Recipients can withdraw the awarded scholarship funds.
- **Smart Contract Security**: The contracts are designed with security and correctness in mind, utilizing the Move language's capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- **Aptos CLI**: You need to have the Aptos CLI installed to deploy and interact with the smart contracts.
- **Move Language**: Familiarity with the Move language is required to understand and modify the smart contracts.
- **Git**: Ensure you have Git installed to clone the repository.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/scholarship-platform.git
   cd scholarship-platform
   ```

2. **Set Up the Project**:

   Ensure your `Move.toml` is correctly configured to reference the `AptosFramework` and `MoveStdlib` dependencies:

   ```toml
   [package]
   name = "scholarship"
   version = "0.1.0"
   license = "Apache-2.0"
   authors = ["Your Name <your.email@example.com>"]

   [dependencies]
   AptosFramework = { git = "https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core.git", subdir = "aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework", rev = "main" }
   MoveStdlib = { git = "https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core.git", subdir = "aptos-move/framework/move-stdlib", rev = "main" }

   [addresses]
   scholarship = "_"

   [dev-addresses]
   default = "0xA550C18"
   ```

3. **Build the Smart Contracts**:

   ```sh
   move build
   ```

4. **Deploy the Contracts**:

   Deploy the contracts to the Aptos blockchain:

   ```sh
   aptos move publish --package-dir path/to/your/package
   ```

## Usage

### Creating a Scholarship

Donors can create a new scholarship with specific criteria:

```move
public fun create_scholarship(
    account: &signer,
    criteria: string::String,
    amount: u64
) {
    // Implementation here
}
```

### Applying for a Scholarship

Students can apply for a scholarship by providing the necessary criteria:

```move
public fun apply_for_scholarship(
    account: &signer,
    scholarship_id: u64,
    application_criteria: string::String
) acquires ScholarshipList {
    // Implementation here
}
```

### Withdrawing Funds

Scholarship recipients can withdraw funds:

```move
public fun withdraw_scholarship(
    account: &signer,
    scholarship_id: u64
) acquires ScholarshipList {
    // Implementation here
}
```

### Viewing Scholarships

You can view all the scholarships:

```move
public fun get_scholarships(): vector<Scholarship> {
    // Implementation here
}
```

## Errors and Handling

The smart contract is designed with error handling in mind. Common errors include:

- **E_CRITERIA_MISMATCH**: Raised if the application criteria do not match the scholarship criteria.
- **E_NO_RECIPIENT**: Raised if there is no recipient for the scholarship.
- **E_NOT_RECIPIENT**: Raised if the caller is not the recipient trying to withdraw funds.
